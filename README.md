# 📊 Candy Candy – Cultural impact on name trends


This project explores whether the broadcast of the anime *Candy Candy* in Spain during the 1980s influenced a decline in the popularity of the name “Susana.” The analysis compares this trend with Uruguay, a country where the anime was not aired. Through data exploration, visualization, and narrative framing, this repository documents how media may shape personal decisions like naming children.

## 🔍 Key Questions

- Did the popularity of *Candy Candy* coincide with a measurable shift in naming trends?
- Is the decline in the name *Susana* statistically significant compared to other names from the show (e.g., Ana, Patricia)?
- Are similar declines visible in countries without strong exposure to the show?

## 📊 Key Findings

- In Spain, **Susana** experienced an abrupt decline in relative frequency after the 1970s.
- In Uruguay, where *Candy Candy* did not air, the decline of **Susana** was minimal and consistent, with no disruption.
- **María** showed consistent growth across both countries, dominating name choices.
- This suggests a potential cultural effect of media narratives on naming trends.

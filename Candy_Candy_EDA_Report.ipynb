    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the 1980s, the anime *Candy Candy* captivated audiences across Latin America and Europe. Beyond its emotional storytelling and beloved characters, its cultural footprint raised an intriguing question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Could the popularity of a fictional character influence real-world name trends?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates that question through the lens of the character **Susana**, who played a pivotal role in a dramatic romantic twist that marked many childhoods. We explore the hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *The broadcast of Candy Candy contributed to a measurable decline in the use of the name \"Susana\" in Spanish-speaking countries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ‡ªWhat you'll find here:\n",
    "- **Data from Spain and Uruguay** (1970â€“2010)\n",
    "- Frequency analysis of names from the show: `Susana`, `Ana`, `Patricia`, and a neutral reference name\n",
    "- **Visualizations** of absolute and relative trends over time\n",
    "- A **statistical test** to evaluate whether Susanaâ€™s decline is significantly different\n",
    "\n",
    "This is both a data exploration and a cultural reflection â€” blending analytics with storytelling to trace how media can shape the choices people make when naming their children.\n",
    "\n",

    "This exploration brought together two seemingly distant worlds: childhood nostalgia and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis showed that the name **Susana** declined notably after the 1980s in Spain, and that decline was **statistically more pronounced** than similar names like Ana or Patricia. Yet, we also observed that in Uruguay, where *Candy Candy* had less media impact, the name Susana declined as well, reminding us that **multiple cultural and social forces** shape naming trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while we can't claim that Candy Candy alone changed baby name choices, we can say this:\n",
